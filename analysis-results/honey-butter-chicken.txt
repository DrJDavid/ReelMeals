2.  **(0:08-0:11) Season Chicken:** In a medium bowl, combine 2-3 tbsp of cornstarch, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of black pepper, and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Dredge the chicken pieces in the cornstarch mixture, ensuring they are fully coated.
3.  **(0:12-0:15) Air Fry Chicken:** Place the coated chicken in the air fryer basket. Spray lightly with cooking oil spray. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 18 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through.
