    *   Ham: Use smoked turkey or prosciutto for a different flavor.
    *   Bread: Sourdough, or a brioche.
*   **Storage Instructions:**
    *   Best eaten immediately. If you must store it, refrigerate leftover pieces and rewarm.
*   **Reheating Instructions:**
    *   Oven: Reheat in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 5-10 minutes.
