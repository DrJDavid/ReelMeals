**8. Tips and Variations:**

*   **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
    *   Using hot rice: Allow the rice to cool slightly before assembling.
    *   Overfilling: Don't add too many ingredients, or it will be difficult to fold.
    *   Not wrapping tightly enough: This can cause the Onigirazu to fall apart.
*   **Substitution Options:**
    *   Salmon, shrimp, or other seafood can be substituted for tuna.
    *   Different vegetables like carrots, daikon radish, or bell peppers can be added.
    *   Use regular rice instead of sushi rice.
    *   Substitute a variety of toppings for the furikake.
    *   Use regular mayonnaise.

*   **Storage Instructions:** Store the wrapped Onigirazu in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Rice can dry out and nori can become soggy if stored for too long.

*   **Reheating Instructions:** Onigirazu is best served cold or at room temperature. Reheating is not recommended as it can change the texture of the rice and other ingredients.
