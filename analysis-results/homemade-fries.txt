3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Cut the potatoes (0:08-0:12)
Cut the potatoes lengthwise into fry-shaped strips (approximately 1/2-inch thick).
Equipment: Cutting board, Chef's knife

Step 2: Par-Boil the Fries (0:13-0:24)
Add 1/4 cup of salt to a large pot of boiling water. Add the cut potato strips to the boiling water. Immediately reduce the heat.
Simmer the potatoes gently until they are "knife tender" when pierced with a knife. (approximately 5-7 minutes)

Step 3: Prepare fries with Potato Starch and Baking Soda (0:24-0:40)
Gently remove the fries from the boiling water.
Add a little bit of the potato water to the bowl of fries.
Add approximately 1 tablespoon of potato starch and a couple of pinches (approximately 1/2 tsp) of baking soda to the bowl of potato fries.
Gently toss the fries to evenly coat with the starch and soda.

Step 4: Freeze the fries (0:40-0:48)
Gently lay the fries on a wire rack in a single layer.
Place in the freezer for approximately 20 minutes.

Step 5: Deep Fry the Fries (0:49-0:57)
Preheat beef tallow in a deep fryer to approximately 350°F (175°C).
Carefully add the partially frozen fries to the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy.
Equipment: Deep Fryer, Frying Basket

Step 6: Season and Serve (0:57-1:17)
Remove the fries from the fryer and place them in a large bowl.
Season immediately with salt, black pepper, fresh chives, grated parmesan cheese, and truffle oil.
Toss to combine evenly.
Serve hot, garnished with extra parmesan cheese.

Cost-saving suggestions:
Use vegetable oil instead of beef tallow to fry fries.
Omit the truffle oil for standard Parmesan Fries
Where to find specialty ingredients:
Beef tallow: Butcher shops, specialty grocery stores, online retailers
Truffle oil: Gourmet food stores, online retailers

8. Tips and Variations:

Common mistakes to avoid:
Overcooking the fries when boiling. They should be knife-tender, not falling apart.
Adding too much potato starch. Just a light coating is needed.
Overcrowding the fryer, which lowers the oil temperature and results in soggy fries.
Using imitation truffle oil, which often tastes artificial.
Burning the fries

Substitution options:
Sweet potatoes can be substituted for russets.
Vegetable or canola oil can be used instead of beef tallow.
Other herbs like parsley or rosemary can be used instead of chives.
Pecorino Romano or Asiago cheese can be used instead of Parmesan.

Storage instructions:
Cooked fries are best eaten immediately. If storing, place cooled fries in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Reheating instructions:
Reheat fries in an air fryer or oven to regain crispiness.
