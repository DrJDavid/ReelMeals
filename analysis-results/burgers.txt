5.  **Cook Smash Burgers (0:34-0:43):** Place the seasoned patties on top of the grilled onions in the pan. Cover with parchment paper and smash again for thinner patty. Cook for approximately 2 and a half minutes per side.
6.  **Add Cheese (0:41-0:43):** Place a slice of cheese on top of each burger patty. Cover the pan with a lid to allow the cheese to melt.
7.  **Make Burger Sauce (0:44-0:49):** Chop any leftover onions and add it to a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of ketchup, 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise, and 1/2 teaspoon of pickle juice. Mix well.
