**3. Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Peel and Slice Potatoes (0:06):** Peel 1 kg of yellow potatoes and slice them into smaller pieces (about 1/2 inch thick) for even cooking. (3 minutes)
2.  **Steam Potatoes (0:07-0:09):** Place the sliced potatoes in a steamer basket over boiling water. Cover and steam for approximately 20 minutes, or until they are very soft. (20 minutes)
3.  **Mash or Rice Potatoes (0:09-0:13):** Once steamed, transfer the potatoes to a bowl. Using a potato ricer or a sieve, push the potatoes to create a very smooth mash.  A ricer or sieve helps remove any lumps and creates a more refined texture. (5 minutes)
4.  **Add Egg Yolks and Seasonings (0:13-0:18):** To the mashed potatoes, add 2 egg yolks, a pinch of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. (2 minutes)
5.  **Add Potato Starch (0:18-0:20):** Add 150g of potato starch. Mix well with your hands until a smooth, non-sticky dough forms. (5 minutes)
6.  **Shape Dumplings (0:21-0:23):** Take handfuls of the dough and shape them into round balls, about 2-3 inches in diameter. Lightly dust with potato starch if the dough is still sticky. (10 minutes)
7.  **Simmer Dumplings (0:23-0:26):** Bring a pot of water to a simmer (not a rolling boil). Gently place the dumplings into the simmering water. Cook on very low heat (almost no bubbling), uncovered, until they float to the surface and are cooked through. This should take around 10-15 minutes. (15 minutes)
8.  **Brown Butter Sauce (0:26-0:29):** In a skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add 1 clove of lightly crushed garlic, a sprig of rosemary, and a few leaves of fresh sage. Cook until the butter browns slightly and the herbs are fragrant. Strain the butter to remove solids. (5 minutes)
9.  **Toast Breadcrumbs (0:30-0:31):** In the same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. Toast until golden brown and crispy. (3 minutes)
10. **Assemble and Serve (0:31-0:40):** Remove the cooked dumplings from the water using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate. Drizzle with the browned butter sauce and top with the toasted breadcrumbs. Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately. (2 minutes)

    *   Burning the butter sauce: Keep a close eye on the butter as it browns.
*   **Substitution Options:**
    *   You can use a different type of potato, but yellow potatoes work best for their creamy texture.
    *   If you don't have potato starch, you can use cornstarch as a substitute, but the texture of the dumplings might be slightly different.
    *   Use other herbs such as thyme or marjoram in the sauce.
    *   Substitute butter for plant-based butter to keep the recipe plant-based.
